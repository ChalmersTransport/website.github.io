# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dedicated to transforming Urban Mobility Systems, my research advances electric vehicle (EV) ecosystems integrated with renewable energy. I develop ML, Agent-based models and optimization algorithms that synergize with renewable energy, enhance EV charging efficiency and support sustainable urban development. I aim to create scalable, intelligent solutions that meet urban planning and mobility's critical efficiency and sustainability requirements.
