# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Arsalan Najafi received the B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran, in 2009 and the M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Birjand, Birjand, Iran, in 2011 and 2016, respectively. He won the grant of the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) under the Ulam Program grant in 20221 to commence his Postdoc in multi-energy systems. His journey in academia has been marked by transitioning from a postdoctoral fellow to an Assistant Professor at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, before his current role as a Postdoc at the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. His commitment to academia and research extends into his pursuit of innovative solutions in multi-energy systems, with a particular focus on transportation electrification, electricity markets, and optimization theory in energy systems.
