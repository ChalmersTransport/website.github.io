Ruo Jia is a postdoctoral researcher in the Urban Mobility Systems group at Chalmers University of Technology.

His research focuses on promoting sustainable and intelligent urban mobility through shared micro-mobility, electrification, and data-driven system modeling. He applies methods including federated learning, demand estimation, and life-cycle assessment to study the environmental and operational impacts of new mobility services across European cities.

He has published on the GHG performance of shared e-scooters, transport network modeling, and optimization of mobility-as-a-service integration. His work supports collaboration with local governments and operators to inform policy and service design.
