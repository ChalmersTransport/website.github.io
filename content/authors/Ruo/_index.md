### ðŸ§  AI-Driven Mobility Planning

Kun works on combining machine learning, network modeling, and simulation to optimize urban transport systems.

- Demand forecasting using federated learning  
- Real-time fleet rebalancing for e-scooters  
- Network accessibility modeling via OpenStreetMap

### ðŸ“Š Data + Policy = Impact

- Collaborating with Gothenburg city on data-driven regulations  
- Supporting policy evaluation under EU transport goals  
- LCA-based emission benchmarking across 100+ European cities
