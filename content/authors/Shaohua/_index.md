Shaohua Cui is a postdoc in the Urban Mobility Systems research group, Division of Geology and Geotechnics, Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering. His research focuses on advancing adaptive control strategies in urban traffic systems, with key interests in mixed traffic flow management, platoon control, and network-level adaptive signal control. Special emphasis is placed on developing novel methods to optimize traffic stability and efficiency in environments with both automated and human-driven vehicles. His work aims to support the design of smarter, safer, and more efficient urban mobility systems through the integration of real-time data and advanced modeling techniques.
