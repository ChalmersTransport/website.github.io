        Our research area focuses on advancing infrastructure, operation and management of emerging transport systems leveraging new technologies to improve sustainability, efficiency, safety and equity of future mobility systems at different scales. We focus on transport engineering to solve systematic and user-centric infrastructure planning and operation optimizations instead of vehicles or vehicular components. We target transport infrastructure and system-level solutions.
